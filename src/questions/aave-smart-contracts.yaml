  explanation: Flash loans can now be executed in batches, which means that many flash loans with varied parameters can be performed in the same call. This opens the door to strong new use cases, such as repaying numerous assets and positions with a single flash loan transaction. You can now do a combination of 'conventional' flash loans that are paid back instantly and flash loans that incur debt (i.e. the flash loan is not paid back immediately).
