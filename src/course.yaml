  - title: Fetch and Show AAVE Data
    key: fetching-aave-data
    details: >
      This chapter talks about how you can fetch real time and time series data
      from AAVE and show it on the UI. It begins with an introduction to Aave,
      then contiues with the Graph & GraphQL and we further discuss about the
      Aave subgraphs. Then we learn how to query Aave's GraphQL database using
      React and implement a Pie chart too. Then we look on to few example
      graphql queries. Later on we discuss about the historical rest data and
      how we can use it to implement a time series graph in react.

  - title: Simple Dapp for Aave Protocol
    key: simple-dapp-for-aave-protocol
    details: >
      This chapter discusses about a simple Dapp that allows users to interact with the Aave protocol on the Ethereum blockchain and further demonstrate how you can build similar applications on top of it.


      Aave is a decentralized finance platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency using overcollateralized loans, where borrowers must deposit a higher value of cryptocurrency as collateral. 
      Our aim is to build a DApp on top of the Aave platform to decrease the user's collateral ratio by adding additional collateral from a separate contract. The DApp will allow users to exchange USDC tokens for LINK tokens based on the USDC threshold on Aave, and then our contract will top up the user's LINK amount by 50% of their eligibility. 
      
      
      The DApp is built using the starter template we discussed in the previous chapter. So, please visit the previous chapter to have a look at the template code if you haven't already.
