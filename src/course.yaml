  - title: Fetch and Show AAVE Data
    key: fetching-aave-data
    details: >-
      Aave's data, like any on-chain application, can be classified into two
      types: 

      1. Realtime data 

      2. Historical data


      This chapter will discuss how you can retrieve real-time and time-series
      data from AAVE to display it on your UI. The following are the topics that
      will be covered:

      1. Importance of Analytics

      2. Fetching Realtime Data

      3. Query Aave's GraphQL data and implement a Pie chart to show liquidity
      ratio.

      4. Fetching Historical Data

      5. Making rest calls to fetch Aave's historical Utilization ratio data and
      show it on the UI

  - title: Simple Dapp for Aave Protocol
    key: simple-dapp-for-aave-protocol
    details: >
      This chapter discusses about a simple Dapp that allows users to interact
      with the Aave protocol on the Ethereum blockchain and further demonstrate
      how you can build similar applications on top of it.


      Aave is a decentralized finance platform that allows users to lend and
      borrow cryptocurrency using overcollateralized loans, where borrowers must
      deposit a higher value of cryptocurrency as collateral.  Our aim is to
      build a DApp on top of the Aave platform to decrease the user's collateral
      ratio by adding additional collateral from a separate contract. The DApp
      will allow users to exchange USDC tokens for LINK tokens based on the USDC
      threshold on Aave, and then our contract will top up the user's LINK
      amount by 50% of their eligibility. 


      The DApp is built using the starter template we discussed in the previous
      chapter. So, please visit the previous chapter to have a look at the
      template code if you haven't already.
