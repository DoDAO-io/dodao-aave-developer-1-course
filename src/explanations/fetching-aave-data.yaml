    AAVE is a DeFi protocol that facilitates the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency tokens using diverse algorithms and smart contracts without centralized intermediaries. 
    It is a non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized manner.
    Aave's GraphQL data layer is a great resource for developers, allowing developers to access data that may not have been available otherwise. This way developers can work with more data and create more advanced applications. 
    Just like any decentralized blockchain application, Aave's data can be classified into three types: 
    - **Real-time data or current information** - This includes the current state and the new events. With real-time data, you can use data visualisations that reflect changes as they occur in real-time. This means that dashboards are interactive and accurate at any given moment.
    - **Historical** - This includes past state and events. With historical data, you can get a snapshot of information displayed in a chart.

    As discussed above, there are multiple use cases of this data provided by Aave and varied applications (including read-only as well as read/write applications) can be built on top of it and we can examine this data to gain insights on how to update and continue to improve the application.

    The focus of this chapter will be to use Aave's data and show it on the UI in a couple of use cases. 
    - Creating a pie graph to review the aave treasury in USDT 
    - Implementing a time series graph of how the holdings of different pools have changed over time.

    Before moving on to the code, let's have a look at the importance of analytics.

    **Importance of Analytics**
    - Make informed decisions
    - Improve efficiency
    - Identify frauds
    - Improve protocol governance
    - Accelerate through uncertainty
    - Tackle bugs and problems
    - Transform raw data into more valuable information

    Aave's data can be queried in the form of REST or GraphQL. Aave uses “The Graph” to index its data and anyone can query the subgraphs to get access to this information.

    #### The Graph and GraphQL
    The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from Ethereum-based blockchains. That is, obtaining specific data from the blockchain is a more convenient approach while adhering to the web3 ethos and benefiting from decentralization and stability.

    The underlying query language used in The Graph is GraphQL. What is the distinction between RESTFUL API calls and GraphQL calls? Traditional APIs, on the other hand, require developers to define unique endpoints for users that return specified data. If the user requires further information, they may need to make repeated API calls, potentially hundreds of API calls, to obtain it. As long as the developer has established a flexible schema, The Graph (which uses GraphQL) just requires one call to a subgraph.
    See this [GraphQL primer](https://medium.com/graphprotocol/graphql-will-power-the-decentralized-web-d7443a69c69a) for additional information on The Graph and the underlying GraphQL.

    #### Source of Aave Subgraphs
    To view the source of the subgraphs, see our [Github repo](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2-subgraph).

    Production Network: [Polygon](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/aave/protocol-v3-polygon)

    #### How to Make Use of the Playground

    - If you use your browser to navigate to the above playground links, you will be directed to The Graph's playground, where you can simply write and test GraphQL queries.
    - Select the purple play button to run your query.
    - In the middle column, the query results will be returned.
    - Use the 'Schema' column on the right to see what data is available, which may be investigated to discover the underlying data.
    - You can also type in the left column and use the auto-complete feature to identify the appropriate query/types.

    #### Points to keep in mind
    - All address values (for example, when used for id) must be in lowercase.
    - In lowercase, the ID of reserves is the asset's address and the address of the market's LendingPoolAddressProvider.
    - When utilizing the raw endpoints, the numeric number queried will be returned in either wei units (i.e. 10^18), the decimals of the asset itself (i.e. 10^6 for USDC), or ray units (i.e. 10^27).
    - By default, each 'page' of results returns 100 entries. This is expandable to a maximum of 1000 entries per page.
    - To list the following 1000 entries, for example, put something like: (skip:1000, first: 1000) to your query's arguments.
    - This is also true for nested entries, such as arrays.

    This Graph endpoint contains only static data. To obtain a user's most recent balance (including interest earned up to that moment), you must either compute it yourself or make a balanceOf() call to the aToken contract.

    | Return Data Type           | Subgraph Address                                                       |
    | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
    | Mainnet                    | https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/aave/aave-v2-matic              |
    | Görli (Goerli) Testnet     | https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/aave/protocol-v3-goerli   |

    Goerli is an Ethereum test network that allows blockchain development testing prior to deployment on the main Ethereum network, Mainnet. Görli (Goerli) Testnet is the first proof-of-authority cross-client testnet, synching Parity Ethereum, Geth, Nethermind, Hyperledger Besu (formerly Pantheon), and EthereumJS. This testnet is a community-based project, completely open-source, naturally. It was born in September 2018 during ETHBerlin and has been growing in contributors ever since.

    #### Using your app to access GraphQL data

    The preferred method is to utilize a client library that can handle the 'plumbing' to ensure you have up-to-date data (with caching sometimes included). Apollo is used internally, but there are several choices depending on your programming language; read the official GraphQL page for more information.
    If you are unable to utilize a client library (for example, while querying using Postman), you can send a POST request to our subgraph's HTTP endpoint with the header: "Content-Type: application/json" and the body comprising of your query on one line in quotations. As an example:
    ```
    {"query": "{ reserves (where: {usageAsCollateralEnabled: true})  { id name price {id} liquidityRate variableBorrowRate stableBorrowRate}}" }
    ```

    #### Examples of Queries

    We'll be using the mainnet Big uints GraphQL endpoints in the queries below. These queries can be copied and pasted into the Graph playground links.

    ##### Reserve Data
    If we want to receive a list of all the reserves that can be used as collateral, as well as the interest rates for each reserve, we can use the following query:
    ```
    {
      reserves (where: {
        usageAsCollateralEnabled: true
      }) {
        id
        name
        price {
          id
        }
        liquidityRate
        variableBorrowRate
        stableBorrowRate
      }
    }
    ```
    We would utilise the reserves ERC20 token address to retrieve data for a certain reserve. For the Chainlink reserve, for example:
    ```
    {
      reserve(id: "0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca0x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8") { // LINK
        symbol
        price
        aToken {
          id
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If we wish to retrieve historical interest rate data for a specific reserve and paginate through the records, our query may look like this:
    ```
    {
      reserve (id: "0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b3760x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8") { // TUSD
        id
        paramsHistory(skip:1000, first: 1000) {
          id
          variableBorrowRate
          utilizationRate
          liquidityRate
          timestamp
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ##### User Data
    When an address communicates with the Aave Protocol, a UserReserve is generated, with the user ID equal to the user's address plus the reserve's ID (which is the ERC20 token address).
    To obtain information on a certain UserReserve:
    ```
    {
      userReserve(id: "USER_ADDRESS_AND_RESERVE_ADDRESS") {
        reserve {
          id
          symbol
        }
        user {
          id
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    To retrieve all reserves (i.e. positions) held by a specific user (notice that the user address must be lower case):
    ```
    {
      userReserves(where: { user: "USER_ADDRESS"}) {
        id
        reserve{
          id
          symbol
        }
        user {
          id
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ##### Deposit data
    To obtain recent deposits for a certain asset:
    ```
    {
      deposits (orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, where: { 
        reserve: "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec70x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8" // USDT
      }) {
        id
        amount
        timestamp
      }
    }
    ```

    ##### Borrow data
    To obtain recent borrows for a certain asset:
    ```
    {
      borrows (orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, where: { 
        reserve: "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec70x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8" // USDT
      }) {
        id
        amount
        timestamp
      }
    }
    ```

    ##### Flash loan data
    For instance, consider the following query for analysing the five most recent Flash Loans:
    ```
    { 
      flashLoans( 
        first: 5 
        orderBy: timestamp 
        orderDirection: desc 
      ) { 
        id 
        reserve { 
          id 
          name 
          symbol 
        } 
        amount 
        totalFee 
        timestamp 
      } 
    } 
    ```
