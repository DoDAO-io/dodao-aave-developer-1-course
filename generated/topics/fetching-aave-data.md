## Fetch and Show AAVE Data
 
This chapter talks about how you can fetch real time and time series data from AAVE and show it on the UI. It begins with an introduction to Aave, then contiues with the Graph & GraphQL and we further discuss about the Aave subgraphs. Then we learn how to query Aave's GraphQL database using React and implement a Pie chart too. Then we look on to few example graphql queries. Later on we discuss about the historical rest data and how we can use it to implement a time series graph in react.
